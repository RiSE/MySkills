                <h4>What do you evaluate when you are recruiting?</h4>

                <p>If you are a recruiter, daily you receive lots of unvalidated resumes that you need to get in contact with, give feedback, filter, validate, interview and after all this cycle you still have lots of other open opportunities to start all over again.</p>

                <p>On the other hand, lots of skills are not represented by common resumes.</p>

                <h4>Learning today happens everywhere</h4>

                <p>But it's often difficult to get recognition for skills and achievements gained outside of the University.</p>

                <h4>Get recognition for new skills and achievements</h4>

                <p>The web and other new learning spaces provide exciting ways to gain skills and experience from online courses, learning networks and mentorship to peer learning, volunteering and after-school programs. Badges provide a way for learners to get recognition for these skills, and display them to potential employers, schools, colleagues and their community.</p>

                <h4>Unlocking new career and learning opportunities</h4>

                <p>By displaying skills and achievements that traditional degrees and transcripts often leave out, badges can lead to jobs, community recognition, and new learning opportunities.</p>

                <h4>Who can Earn Badges? Programmers</h4>

                <p>A Badge Earner is any programmer who collects and stores their badges within our systems. MySkills.com.br acts as the conduit between a Badge Issuer and a Badge Earner, permitting an earner to earn, accept, store, and manage badges within their Mozilla Backpack. From there they can choose to display their badges on a variety of sites, including blogs, social media sites, and personal websites.</p>

                <h4>Who can  Provide Badges? Our Partners</h4>

                <p>We are creating partnerships with Badge Issuers (for example, after-school programs, free online courses, and vocational institutes) who can award Badges to programmers like you. Learners/badge earners can then collect and manage their badges in a Badge Backpack. 
                    This makes it easy to display your skills and achievements across a range of different Display Sites - from your personal resume or web site, to social networking profiles, to employment sites. The result? Jobs, new learning opportunities and unlocked potential.". </p>
